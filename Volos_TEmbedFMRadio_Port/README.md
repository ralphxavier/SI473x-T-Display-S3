# TEmbedFMRadio sketch from Volos Projects ported to the Si473x.

This Si473x Radio uses the amazing library written by [PU2CLR (Ricardo Caratti)](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735). It is based on sketch from [Volos Projects](https://github.com/VolosR/TEmbedFMRadio). [Volos Projects](https://www.youtube.com/@VolosProjects) YouTube channel has a lot of tips and tricks for Lilygo T-Embed and Lilygo T-Display. I recommend this YouTube channel if you want to know more about this device and also about the tft_espi library, especially how to use sprites.

I am using a [Lilygo T-Display S3](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Display-S3), which is an ESP32S3 board with a 1.9 inch display with a 8-Bit Parallel Interface, but I believe it will also run on [Lilygo T-Embed](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Embed) by commentting out the line "#define I_use_T_Display_S3.

If you want just to look and feel the interface, it's also possible to run this sketch without Si473x. To do this, uncomment de line "#define SI4735_EMUL"

For now, my sketch only runs FM without RDS. On reset, all settings will return to default.

# Special instructions for the TFT_eSPI Library

It is extremely important to follow all the steps indicated on Lilygo github:

[Lilygo T-Display S3] (https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Display-S3#quick-start)

[Lilygo T-Embed] (https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Embed#quick-start)


# Releases

## [V0.2 - RDS Feature added]

 - RDS Feature added
 - Performance improvements

## [V0.1 - Initial Release]

First release. For now, FM only. On reset, all settings will return to default.

    This release implements different behaviors for different "press and hold" durations on its single button.
    
        - Single click:     Volume control. Another single click to return to the "frequency mode"
        - Double click:     Select stations from the list on the left.
        - Triple click:     Mute/Unmute.
        - Press and hold:   Set stations in the list on the left.
